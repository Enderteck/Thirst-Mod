**Thirst was Taken** is a simple mod that adds a thirst mechanic to the game, but that fits well in modpacks (especially **aesthetics**-oriented ones) by adding diverse features and compatibility with a lot of often-used mods.

This mod is heavily inspired by the other thirst/survival mods out there, including Dehydration, Tough as Nails, and Cold Sweat.

To learn more about this mod, you can visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod/wiki).
